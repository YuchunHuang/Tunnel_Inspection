# Tunnel_Inspection

Tunnel Linings Inspection Using Bayesian-Optimized (BO) Calibration of Multiple Line-Scan Cameras (LSCs) and a Laser Range Finder (LRF)

The data were collected from Zengjiawan Tunnel (Hubei North Expressway, Yidu to Yuyangguan, 2 lanes) and Foling Tunnel (Mazhu Expressway, Yibao section, Baokang to Shiping, 1 lane). The images captured by the cameras and the point cloud obtained by radar are stored in the Laser_LSS and Tunnel_LCS folders, respectively.

We express our gratitude to Wuhan JingShiYaoCe Co., Ltd. for their assistance in data collection and processing.

The experimental code will be organized and uploaded shortly.
